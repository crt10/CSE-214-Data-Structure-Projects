# CSE-214-Data-Structure-Projects

This repository contains all the projects required to pass my CSE-214 Data Structures course in Stony Brook University.

##hw1

Homework 1 was to implement a planner manager. It would simulate the system for adding courses into our school scheduele.

##hw2

Homework 2 was to implement linked lists to manage a train. Each train car would represent a node and the whole train would represent a linked list.

##hw3

Homework 3 goes through some code in python to determine the Big-Oh notation for each "block" of code. After determining the O(n) of each block, an overall complexity of the code is returned.

##hw4

Homework 4 runs simulations of routers sending packets to one destination router. The project was to teach us how to implement queues.

##hw5

Homework 5 was to simulate a bash terminal for traversing through a filesystem. The project implements a data tree for its filesystem. methods for 'pwd', 'ls', 'cd', 'mkdir', 'touch', 'find', 'mv', and 'exit' were implemented.

##hw6

Homework 6 allows users to import auction data from a .xml file and manipulate it locally. Each auction is put into a hashtable.

##hw7

Homework 7 provides a GUI interface for running a simulation of a search engine. Each website is put into a directed graph, where links between websites are represented by a directed edge.
